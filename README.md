## Description
This repository contains two microservices implemented in Go (Golang), integrated with RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging. Utilizing ORM for data persistence and following the principles of clean architecture, these microservices facilitate efficient communication within a distributed e-commerce system, focusing on backend functionalities.

## Project Status
The project is under development.

## Features and Application Demo
- **Microservice E-commerce (microsservice-ecommerce):**
  - Manages orders using clean architecture principles.
  - Utilizes ORM for data persistence.
  - Notifies the admin backend about order-related actions via RabbitMQ.
- **Microservice E-commerce Admin (microsservice-ecommerce-admin):**
  - Processes order notifications and records daily sales.
  - Utilizes ORM and clean architecture principles.
  - Periodically synchronizes inventory with the ecommerce backend.
